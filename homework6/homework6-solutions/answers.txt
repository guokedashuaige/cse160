Answer to Problem 7:

The results of many trials all suggest that the Iranian election results were
fraudulent. Here is one of the outputs where the rejection level p is smaller
than the threshold of 0.05:

2009 Iranian election MSE: 0.0007395833333333338
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 372
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 9628
2009 Iranian election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.0372

Answer to Problem 8:

I don't think that the US election was fraudulent because the null hypothesis
rejection level is quite high (near to 0.5). Below is a sample output for US:

2008 United States election MSE: 0.00014100258760580583
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2008 United States  election MSE: 4759
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2008 United States election MSE: 5241
2008 United States election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.4759
